abstract: 'Here, through single-molecule real-time sequencing, we present a high-quality genome sequence of the Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi), a conifer species with great value for wood production and ecological afforestation. The assembled genome is 10.97â€‰Gb in size, harboring 45,828 protein-coding genes. Of the genome, 66.8% consists of repeat sequences, of which long terminal repeat retrotransposons are dominant and make up 69.86%. We find that tandem duplications have been responsible for the expansion of genes involved in transcriptional regulation and stress responses, unveiling their crucial roles in adaptive evolution. Population transcriptome analysis reveals that lignin content in L. kaempferi is mainly determined by the process of monolignol polymerization. The expression values of six genes (LkCOMT7, LkCOMT8, LkLAC23, LkLAC102, LkPRX148, and LkPRX166) have significantly positive correlations with lignin content. These results indicated that the increased expression of these six genes might be responsible for the high lignin content of the larches wood. Overall, this study provides new genome resources for investigating the evolution and biological function of conifer trees, and also offers new insights into wood properties of larches.'
