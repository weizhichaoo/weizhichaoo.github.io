abstract: 'Hybrid genomes usually harbor asymmetrical parental contributions. However, it is challenging to infer the functional significance of asymmetrical retention of parental alleles in hybrid populations of conifer trees. Here we investigated the diversity in the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene family in a hybrid pine Pinus densata and its parents (Pinus tabuliformis and Pinus yunnanensis). Plant GSTs play major roles in protecting plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, 19 orthologous groups of GST genes were identified and cloned from these three species. We examined their expression in different tissues, and then purified the corresponding proteins to characterize their enzymatic activities and specificities toward different substrates. We found that among the 19 GST orthologous groups, divergence in gene expression and in enzymatic activities toward different substrates was prevalent. P. densata preferentially retained P. yunnanensis-like GSTs for 17 out of the 19 gene loci. We determined the first GST crystal structure from conifer species at a resolution of 2.19 Å. Based on this structure, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to replace amino acid residuals in different wild-types of GSTs to understand their functional impacts. Reciprocal replacement of amino acid residuals in native GSTs of P. densata and P. tabuliformis demonstrated significant changes in enzyme functions and identified key sites controlling GSTs activities. This study illustrates an approach to evaluating the functional significance of sequence variations in conifer genomes. Our study also sheds light on plausible mechanisms for controlling the selective retention of parental alleles in the P. densata genome.'
