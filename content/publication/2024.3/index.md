abstract: 'Trees account for approximately 90% of the Earths biomass and provide humans with various necessities for survival, such as clean air and water, wood, fibre and fuel (Petit and Hampe, 2006; Tuskan et al., 2006). Compared with annual plants, trees have many significant features, such as perennial growth, large size, secondary growth from a vascular cambium and dormancy (Douglas, 2017). Trees should be considered as a model system in plant biology and provide possibilities to answer questions that cannot be easily solved in the annual model systems of Arabidopsis and rice.'
